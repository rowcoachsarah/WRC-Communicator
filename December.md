# December Happenings
Hello WRC Team, 

I want to implement something new to help facilitate communication with the coaches & make sure you know what is going on at the boathouse. I'll share a weekly highlight communicator & invite for any important information in case someone wants to be involved in it. This week I have 3 highlights for you:

1. [Equipment](https://github.com/rowcoachsarah/WRC-Communicator/blob/main/December.md#equipment) 
2. Master Plan
3. Partnership Potential
