# December Happenings
Hello WRC Team, 

I want to implement something new to help facilitate communication with the coaches & make sure you know what is going on at the boathouse. I have made this blog/website communicator to share with you the highlights & happenings on the ground at the boathouse. This will also help me look at where we are coming from and move towards where we are going. This week I have three highlights for you.

## Equipment
You may see more boats in the bay! Some are ours. CRI generously donated six sculling boats to us: 
-stable Maas 1x, perfect for learning to row & future members who want to just get out on the water and not worry about balance in a skinny boat.  
-2 Wintech 24's: intermediate boats, more durable and stable than racing singles but a little harder than the Maas
-1 Wintech 2x! 
-One Vespoli racing single. Older boat but looks to be in excellent shape

We have also gotten boats in the past several weeks to fill out our sweeps fleet from Nobles, Windsor, CBS and Cambridge Latin among others. We have enough sweeps boats to have lots of juniors and adults on the water this spring! In addition, Blair from Nobles who generously donated 4 boats to us also put me in touch with Dan Boyne from Harvard and as you know we are purchasing two Peinart 26's - workhorse heavy duty, but fast singles to add to our fleet. I know these will be popular boats. 

## Master Plan
New Year - Start Strong, Stay Strong! The Programming Committee has been working on a fun way to start off 2022!
In January we will piggyback on the existing Concept2 January Team challenge to inspire our rowers to pull meters as well as to do some "friend-raising" by inviting other people who erg to join our C2 January Challenge team and have a little in house competition and that will culminate with a th*ROW* down on February 13th where we will invite everyone to come compete in both in house erg springs and the 2022 Virtual Indoor Rowing World Championships: CRASH-B's! This will be the first of its kind at WRC and no matter if we are a large and mighty group or a small but powerful team of people, it will be a great way to have fun, make friends, and let people know about WRC! 

## Partnership Potential
Sandra & I have been thinking a lot about recruiting, pipeline development etc. Some of you know about Stem to Stern, an organization that comes alongside teams and helps them become more diverse and competitive through focusing on helping clubs develop inclusive middle school programs and adding a STEM component. All their resources are free and they are about furthering the sport. Partnering with them can be a great benefit to us and helping grow our team. Sandra and I see it as a great resource to help us move forward and I know many of you are excited about this potential as well. Particularly helpful is that it has a great framework for volunteers including working with local universities tapping into our willing parents and WRC Masters rowers. Stem to Stern also has curriculum for STEM educational components that I envision being a great aeddition at our summer camps and to our program as a whole. 

I hope next week we will have an informational meeting about S2S at WRC and start taking the first steps to cement this partnership.
